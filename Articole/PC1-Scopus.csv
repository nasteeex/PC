A single classifier algorithm will be compared against the performance and efficiency of ensemble classifiers. Reducing student attrition is a major problem for educational institutions all over the world. The search for solutions to increase student retention and graduation rates continues for educators. This is only possible if at-risk students are identified and intervened with as soon as possible. However, the majority of regularly used prediction models are inefficient and inaccurate as a result of inherent classifier limitations and the inclusion of insignificant inputs in their calculations. The majority of data mining and machine learning researcher focused on developing an algorithm that can extract useful information from massive amounts of data after being processed by a computer. The most difficult problem in predictive modelling is identifying the most effective prediction algorithms that are also accurate enough to be useful. Therefore, a multi-level homogeneous ensemble predictive (MLHoEP) model is designed, which uses the different techniques of data mining like feature selection, ensemble learning techniques like boosting and bagging. Seven distinct machine learning algorithms were used on this model to predict and analyse the academic performance of the students. The performance of the classification algorithms in terms of prediction was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by suggesting the development of homogeneous classifiers that may be used to accurately predict students’ academic success. It also proposes the construction of homogeneous classifiers, which may be deployed for accurate student performance prediction, in order to provide a better explanation for the poor performance prediction. As a result of this research, it has been demonstrated that the technique of applying homogeneous ensemble approaches is incredibly efficient and accurate in terms of predicting student performance and assisting in identifying students, who are in danger of dropping out of school. The study compared the accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers to ensembles of classifiers in terms of performance. It was discovered in the research that a homogeneous model with excellent accuracy and efficiency might be developed for anticipating student performance. These key problems have been successfully addressed by the findings of this research study: Which characteristics of students are the most effective predictors of academic performance? How accurate are approaches such as bagging and boosting ensembles for predicting student academic performance? The approach offered in this study will aid educational administrators and policymakers in designing new policies and curriculum-linked to student retention in higher education. This research can also aid in the identification of students who are at risk of dropping out of school early, providing for timely intervention and support. Prospective research will examine the creation and implementation of an automated prediction system known as the students’ academic performance forecast framework, which will collect data from students via online submission and produce a prediction result for their academic performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2023","2023-01-03 16:47:56","2023-01-03 16:48:14","","139-159","","","473","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","ISBN: 9789811928208","","","","","Correlation attribute evaluation; Educational data mining; Ensemble learning; Gain ratio; Information gain; Multilayer perceptron; Naïve Bayes; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system. Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems, especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning, which has been used for decades in data processing in different contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification in the application of this technique to extract relevant information from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions.

However, previous studies used questionnaires, surveys, and/or interviews to investigate factors affecting students’ learning performance. These methods cannot help universities to provide on-time support to excellent and poor students. Thus, this study utilized Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms to build prediction models for the academic performance of international students, students with disabilities, and local students based on students’ admission profiles and their first-semester Grade Point Average results. The real samples included 4036 freshmen of a Taiwanese technical and vocational university. The experimental results showed that for international students, three models: SVM (100%), MLP (100%), and DT (100%) were significantly superior to RF (96.6%); for students with disabilities, SVM (100%) outperformed RF (98.0%), MLP (96.0%), and DT (94.0%); for local students, RF (98.6%) outperformed DT (95.2%) MLP (94.9%), and SVM (91.9%). The most important features were [numbers of required credits], [main source of living expenses], [department], [father occupations], [mother occupations], [numbers of elective credits], [parent average income per month], and [father education].

This research aims at predicting students' completion based on socio-demographic information. Unlike previous work, a dynamic prediction model was proposed here. Real data of 13262 undergraduate students at a public university in Iraq was integrated and cleaned first. This was followed by applying several feature selection techniques to identify relevant socio-demographic features that can affect the prediction of students' completion. This includes using correlation-based feature subset selection (CfsSubsetEval), symmetrical uncertainty with respect to the class (SymmetricalUncertAttributeEval), GainRatioAttributeEval, ReliefFAttributeEval, and CorrelationAttributeEval. Finally, a prediction model was built based on six prediction approaches which are Bagging, DecisionTable, HoeffdingTree, IBK, J48, RandomForest, and RandomTree. Overall, several different features showed a significant effect on students' completion in which societal regression and the type of secondary school had the highest weight. Furthermore, comparing the accuracy of the implemented classification techniques can reveal that the Bagging classifier outperforms other approaches. The accuracy of predicting students' completion based on this method was 87.56%.

It has become an imperative research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of student performance prediction in the context of educational data mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of student performance prediction and compare approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for students’ performance prediction. Students’ academic records and demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable information to researchers interested in advancing educational data mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate prediction results in different scenarios using different available inputs or techniques.

Research is improving and growing fast in Educational Data Mining (EDM) due to many students' information. Researchers urge to invent valuable patterns about students' learning behavior using their data that needs to be adequately processed to transform it into helpful information. This paper proposes a prediction model of students' academic performances with new data features, including student's behavioral features, Psychometric, family support, learning logs via e-learning management systems, and demographic information. In this paper, data collection and pre-processing are firstly conducted following the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic scores. Later, we selected the applicable supervised learning algorithms, and then the experimental work was implemented. The performance of the student's predictive model assessment is comprised of three steps: First, the critical Feature selection approach is evaluated. Second, a set of renowned classifiers are trained and tested. Third, ensemble meta-based models are improvised to boost the accuracy of the classifier.

The conception of student performance prediction models focused to classify the academic performance of student is the important factor of the growth of Education Data Mining (EDM). It is one of the important and predictable processes that are performed over the huge education background. Data mining methods are employed to build the prediction models for the educational dataset. But it has issue with huge amount of features from the specified dataset hence the prediction accuracy of student's performance is degraded significantly. To overcome the above mentioned problems, in this work, Improved Conditional Generative Adversarial Network -with Parallel Support Vector Machine (ICGAN-PSVM) algorithm is proposed. It is focused to predict students' performance under supportive learning through school and family tutoring which increases the prediction accuracy considerably. This research includes main steps are feature selection and prediction process. The feature selection process is done via Modified Chicken Swarm Optimization (MCSO) algorithm. It is utilized to choose the more appropriate features from the University dataset. The objective function of MCSO algorithm is used to improve the students' performance via selecting best fitness features. Then the prediction is performed by using ICGAN-PSVM algorithm which is used to classify the more accurate student's performance prediction results.

The selection of features for student's performance prediction not only plays significant role in increasing prediction accuracy, but also helps in building the strategic plans for the improvement of students' academic performance. There are different feature selection algorithms for predicting the performance of students, however the studies reported in the literature claim that there are different pros and cons of existing feature selection algorithms in selection of optimal features. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection framework (using feature-fusion) is designed to identify the significant features and associated features with target class, to predict the performance of students. The main goal of the proposed hybrid feature selection is not only to improve the prediction accuracy, but also to identify optimal features for building productive strategies for the improvement in students' academic performance. The key difference between proposed hybrid feature selection framework and existing hybrid feature selection framework, is two level feature fusion technique, with the utilization of cosine-based fusion. Whereas, according to the results reported in existing literature, cosine similarity is considered as the best similarity measure among existing similarity measures. The proposed hybrid feature selection is validated on four benchmark datasets with variations in number of features and number of instances. The validated results confirm that the proposed hybrid feature selection framework performs better than the existing hybrid feature selection framework, existing feature selection algorithms in terms of accuracy, f-measure, recall, and precision.

Since there is an increase in the number of drop out students every year, if we are able to predict whether a student will complete the course or not, it is possible to take some preventive actions beforehand. The primary data set used for modelling has been taken from a reputed technical institute of Uttar Pradesh which consists of data of 6,807 students containing 20 academic and non-academic attributes. The most relevant attributes are extracted using CorrelationAttributeEval (in WEKA) technique using Ranker search method which ranks the attributes as per their evaluation. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) filter is applied to deal with the skewed data set. The models are built from eight classifiers that are analysed for predicting the most appropriate model to classify whether a student will complete the course or withdraw his/her admission. © 2021 IGI Global.

Educational data mining (EDM) is an upward field of research, and it is very helpful for academic institutions to predict the academic performance of the students. Educational datasets are the basis of various predictive models. Quality of these models can be improved by using feature selection (FS). To get the required benefits from the available data, there must be some tools for analysis and prediction. In lieu of the above, machine learning/data mining are most suitable. In educational data mining, for better accuracy of prediction models’ and quality of various educational datasets, feature selection (FS) plays a vital role. Feature selection (FS) algorithms abolish inappropriate information from the repositories of educational background so that performance of classifier in terms of accuracy could be increased and the same could be used for better decision. In lieu of the above, a best feature selection algorithm must be selected. In this paper, two filter selection approaches namely correlation feature selection (CFS) and wrapper-based feature selection have been used to demonstrate the importance of selection of a feature subset for a classification problem. The present paper aims to find the detailed investigation of filter feature selection algorithms along with the classification algorithms on a given dataset. We found result with numerous numbers of features from various Feature selection algorithms and classifiers which will help the researcher to discover the most excellent mixture of filter feature selection algorithms and its associated classifiers. The result indicates that SMO and J48 have the highest accuracy measures with the correlation feature selection algorithms, while Naïve Bayes has the highest accuracy measures with the wrapper subset feature selection algorithms for predicting high, medium and low grade for the students. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2021","2023-01-03 16:56:11","2023-01-03 16:56:12","","317-328","","","1165","","","Feature Selection Algorithms and Student Academic Performance","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","ISBN: 9789811551123","","","","","Correlation feature selection; Feature selection algorithms; J48; Random forest; Wrapper feature selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the present paper we applied an attribute selection algorithm to identify the most important factors influencing drop out decision. Decision trees were used to define patterns that can alert an imminent dropout. A tool was adapted and administered online to 300 students from public HEIs, and 200 students from private HEIs currently enrolled on a higher education program. By means of the attribute selection algorithm, 27 relevant factors were found. Within the three main factors, the lack of counselling, an adequate student environment and academic follow-up were recognized, whilst, 7 patterns were found through the decision tree. These included factors such as: student environment, insufficient financial support, experience of an uncomfortable situation and place of career choice, amongst others. Finally, it has been seen that school drop-out does not depend on a single factor but is multifactorial. It is imperative to expand the sample to include other cities. This will enable various algorithms to be applied, providing greater information and leading to the establishment of accurate mechanisms for reducing university drop-out rates, according to the characteristics of the student population in each region. © 2020 Universidad de Valencia.","2020","2023-01-03 16:56:41","2023-01-03 16:56:41","","1-19","","1","26","","","University dropout","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\B33FBYU5\Urbina-Nájera et al. - 2020 - University dropout Prevention patterns through th.pdf","","","Computer learning; Counseling; Decision trees; Feature selection; Student environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Educational data mining (EDM) offers various effective prediction models to predict student performance. Simultaneously, feature selection (FS) is a method of EDM that is utilized to determine the dominant factors that are needed and sufficient for the target concept. FS method extracts high-quality data that reduce the complexity of the prediction task that can increase the robustness of decision rule. In this paper, we provide a comparative study of feature selection methods for determining dominant factors that highly affect classification performance and improve the performance of prediction models. A new feature selection CHIMI based on ranked vector score is proposed. Analysis of feature sets of each FS method to get the dominant set is executed. The experimental results show that by using the dominant set of the proposed CHIMI method, the classification performance of the proposed models is significantly improved. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.","2020","2023-01-03 16:56:58","2023-01-03 16:56:58","","492-502","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\HLJNCXXL\Sokkhey and Okazaki - 2020 - Study on dominant factor for academic performance .pdf","","","Dominant factors; Educational data mining; Feature selection methods; Prediction models; Student performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the applications of EDM is the prediction of performance of students. In a web based education system, the behavioural features of learners are very significant in showing the interaction between students and the LMS. In this paper, our aim is to propose a new performance prediction model for students which is based on data mining methods which includes new features known as behavioural features of students and based on sequential feature selection which is used to identify most important features. The proposed performance model is evaluated using classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT). Furthermore, so as to enhance the classifiers performance, the ensemble methods such as Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest were applied. The achieved results show that there exists a strong relationship between behaviour of students and their academic performance. An accuracy of 91.5% was gotten when the ensemble methods were applied to the classifiers to improve the academic performance. Thus, the result gotten shows the reliability of the proposed model. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","2019","2023-01-03 16:58:07","2023-01-03 16:58:07","","","","","551","","","Educational Data Mining","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","ISSN: 1757-8981 Issue: 1","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\KBLWIB4N\Ajibade et al. - 2019 - Educational Data Mining Enhancement of Student Pe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous PSP studies construct prediction models mainly on data collected from questionnaires or some specific learning systems. Instead, students’ Internet access logs were used in this study to predict high-risk students. Since the raw data in log files are high-dimensional, complex and full of noise, several methods were proposed for the preprocessing of the data source. A high-dimensional feature selection framework is then designed to prepare features for the construction of a prediction model with good trade-off between computational efficiency and prediction performance. Experiments showed that the proposed prediction model can identify about 85% of high-risk students. Some online characteristics of high-risk students were also discovered, which might help student counselors and educational researchers better understand the relationship between students’ Internet use and their academic performance. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","2018","2023-01-03 16:58:40","2023-01-03 16:58:40","","393-413","","2","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","Classification; Educational data mining; Feature selection; Predicting student performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
