Six data mining algorithms were considered, and a maximum accuracy of 89.15% was achieved. The result was verified using both linear and pure quadratic regression models, and R2 values of 0.955 and 0.957 were recorded for both cases. This creates an opportunity for identifying students that may graduate with poor results or may not graduate at all, so that early intervention may be deployed.","2019-02-01","2023-01-03 15:31:21","2023-01-03 15:31:26","2023-01-03 15:31:21","e01250","","2","5","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\VZJ4KMDV\Adekitan and Salau - 2019 - The impact of engineering students' performance in.pdf","","","Computer science; Education; Information science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many researchers recently tackled this problem by proposing different frameworks for predicting students' academic performance. However, previous work relies heavily on feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, manipulating, and constructing new variables from raw data using domain knowledge. A disadvantage of feature engineering is that the features are tailored to a specific dataset making the constructed models inflexible when used in new datasets. A direct consequence is that features need to be rebuilt for each course. This paper proposes a more flexible framework to predict the students' academic performance. In this framework, the raw data is used directly to construct the prediction model without the feature engineering step. The feature selection is instead based on model interpretability. The framework is applied to the open university learning analytics dataset (OULAD) with two different type of classifiers: random forest and artificial neural networks. Obtained results show that the feature engineering step can be abandoned without affecting the models' prediction performance. The prediction results of the flexible feature selection framework either outperform or have a difference of less than 1% accuracy compared to other work in the literature that relies on a manual feature engineering step. Both random forest and artificial neural networks without feature engineering accomplish a high prediction accuracy for the case of students at risk of failing with 86% and 88% compared to all students with pass grades and students with distinction grades, respectively. Also, the prediction models have the highest accuracy rate of 93% in predicting drop-out students. Yet, the prediction models in the proposed framework and previous research work perform poorly in predicting high achieving students with maximum accuracy of 81%, a precision of 69%, and a recall of 57%.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","100103","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\E46A96UX\Al-Zawqari et al. - 2022 - A flexible feature selection approach for predicti.pdf","","","Deep learning; Feature selection; Learning analytics; Random forest classifier; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, it proposes PSC to design a classification model capable of classifying questions into the six cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy. To this end, this paper proposes a novel specialized initialization mechanism based on Rocchio Algorithm (RA) to mitigate the adverse effects of the curse of dimensionality on the PSC performance. Furthermore, in the design of the RA-based PSC model of questions classification, several feature selection approaches are investigated. In doing so, a dataset of teachers' classroom questions was collected, annotated manually with Bloom's cognitive levels, and transformed into a vector space representation. Using this dataset, several experiments are conducted, and the results show a poor performance of the standard PSC due to the curse of dimensionality. However, when the proposed RA-based initialization mechanism is used, a significant improvement in the average performance, from 0.243 to 0.663, is obtained. In addition, the results indicate that the feature selection approaches play a role in the performance of the RA-based PSC (average performance ranges from 0.535 to 0.708). Finally, a comparison between the performance of RA-based PSC (average performance=0.663) and seven machine learning approaches (best average performance=0.646) confirms the effectiveness of the proposed RA-based PSC approach.","2019-01-01","2023-01-03 15:36:45","2023-01-03 15:36:45","2023-01-03 15:36:45","35-51","","1","31","","Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\2E2TQ4KS\Yahya - 2019 - Swarm intelligence-based approach for educational .pdf","","","Bloom's taxonomy; Educational data mining; Particle swarm classification; Questions classification; Rocchio Algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be since the implementation of LA in national or regional scope and using data from governments and institutions poses many challenges that may threaten the success of such initiatives, including the same availability of data. The present article describes the experience of LA in Latin America using governmental data from Elementary and Middle Schools of the State of Norte de Santander - Colombia. This study is focusing on students' performance. Data from 2013 to 2018 was collected, containing information related to 1) students’ enrollment in school disciplines provided by Regional Education Secretary, 2) students qualifications provided by educational institutions, and 3) students qualifications provided by the national agency for education evaluation. The methodology followed includes a process of cleaning and integration of the data, subsequently a descriptive and visualization analysis is made and some educational data mining techniques are used (decision trees and clustering) for the modeling and extraction of some educational patterns. A total of eight patterns of interest are extracted. In addition to the decision trees, a feature ranking analysis was performed using xgboost and to facilitate the visual representation of the clusters, t-SNE and self-organized maps (SOM) were applied as result projection techniques. Finally, this paper compares the main challenges mentioned by the literature according to the Colombian experience and proposes an up-to-date list of challenges and solutions that can be used as a baseline for future works in this area and aligned with the Latin American context and reality.","2021-09-01","2023-01-03 15:37:04","2023-01-03 15:37:04","2023-01-03 15:37:04","e08017","","9","7","","Heliyon","Unveiling educational patterns at a regional level in Colombia","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\KEI2FZG7\Hernández-Leal et al. - 2021 - Unveiling educational patterns at a regional level.pdf","","","Educational data; Educational data mining; Learning Analytics; Primary education; Secondary education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes.

Consequently, the output of traditional faculty feedback analysis is not a true indicator of faculty effectiveness in the teaching learning process. The paper presents a proactive and outcome based faculty feedback analysis model which uses Naïve Bayes Classifier to cull out and classify the feedback provided by each student into valid or invalid categories on the basis of the relative effect of aforementioned quality features on the feedback measure. The above quality features are used to refine the feedback measure. The method attempts to address the imprecision to overcome the limitations of the traditional model. Consequently, the output of faculty feedback analysis results in a more refined and accurate Faculty Effectiveness Index. The Faculty Effectiveness Index is calculated as weighted average of only the valid feedback measures with the validity of feedback taken as the associated weight. The classifier takes into consideration the independent contribution of each of the features as well as the multiple evidences of their occurrences in the feedback provided by each student.

To explore the big data generated from a huge amount of learners’ micro-behaviors as the user behavior features for establishing a good CMCCFM, this study developed the learning micro-behavior classification structure according to the collected data features and the concepts of CMC competence. Additionally, an effective method for constructing a CMCCFM with high correctness and stableness was proposed and examined its forecasting effectiveness. The effects of learning situations on the prediction accuracy of CMCCFM were also explored. Analytical results show that the CMCCFM developed by the five considered machine learning schemes all have good prediction performance to some degree. Among the five considered machine learning schemes, the sequence minimum optimization regression algorithm with the model complexity parameter set to 0.1 has the highest prediction accuracy and stability. The key features that influence the prediction accuracy most are “communication behavior” and “communication objective.” Moreover, the development of the CMCCFM must consider the learning situations and learners’ traits, such as discussion trait and familiar degree with the problem-solving subject, because those would affect the prediction accuracy of the developed CMCCFM.","2020-01-01","2023-01-03 15:46:36","2023-01-03 15:46:36","2023-01-03 15:46:36","100004","","","1","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\M7CHVW4Q\Chih-Ming and Ying-You - 2020 - Developing a computer-mediated communication compe.pdf","","","Computer-mediated communication; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Evaluation methodologies; Interactive learning environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size.

In this study, we examined students’ behaviors in online self-assessment task and how it affects their learning performance. A 6-week experiment was conducted in an accounting course. Students were instructed to complete online self-assessment in the form of formative quizzes after class. We performed clustering analysis, which revealed three behavioral patterns in online self-assessment, and we compared the learning performance of students across different patterns. The results indicated that students who frequently took the online assessments after class tended to achieve a higher examination score than those who did not. However, the learning performance of students who demonstrated nonstandard behaviors did not necessarily improve, even though they actively took the assessments.

If we are able to detect at-risk students in the initial stages of the course, we will have more time to improve their performance. Likewise, excellent students could be motivated with customized additional activities. This is why there are research works aimed to early detect students’ performance. Some of them try to achieve it with the analysis of LMS log files, which store information about student interaction with the LMS. Many works create predictive models with the log files generated for the whole course, but those models are not useful for early prediction because the actual log information used for predicting is different to the one used to train the models. Other works do create predictive models with the log information retrieved at the early stages of courses, but they are just focused on a particular type of course. In this work, we use machine learning to create models for the early prediction of students' performance in solving LMS assignments, by just analyzing the LMS log files generated up to the moment of prediction. Moreover, our models are course agnostic, because the datasets are created with all the University of Oviedo1 courses for one academic year. We predict students' performance at 10%, 25%, 33% and 50% of the course length. Our objective is not to predict the exact student's mark in LMS assignments, but to detect at-risk, fail and excellent students in the early stages of the course. That is why we create different classification models for each of those three student groups. Decision tree, nave Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and support vector machine models are created and evaluated. Accuracies of all the models grow as the moment of prediction increases. Although all the algorithms but nave Bayes show accuracy differences lower than 5%, MLP obtains the best performance: from 80.1% accuracy when 10% of the course has been delivered to 90.1% when half of it has taken place. We also discuss the LMS log entries that most influence the students' performance. By using a clustering algorithm, we detect six different clusters of students regarding their interaction with the LMS. Analyzing the interaction patterns of each cluster, we find that those patterns are repeated in all the early stages of the course. Finally, we show how four out of those six student-LMS interaction patterns have a strong correlation with students' performance.","2021-04-01","2023-01-03 15:48:33","2023-01-03 15:48:33","2023-01-03 15:48:33","104108","","","163","","Computers & Education","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\QJEPA6G5\Riestra-González et al. - 2021 - Massive LMS log data analysis for the early predic.pdf","","","Early prediction; Interaction patterns; Learning management systems; Machine learning; Student performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a two-stage model, supported by data mining techniques, that uses the information available at the end of the first year of students' academic career (path) to predict their overall academic performance. Unlike most literature on educational data mining, academic success is inferred from both the average grade achieved and the time taken to conclude the degree. Furthermore, this study proposes to segment students based on the dichotomy between the evidence of failure or high performance at the beginning of the degree program, and the students' performance levels predicted by the model. A data set of 2459 students, spanning the years from 2003 to 2015, from a European Engineering School of a public research University, is used to validate the proposed methodology. The empirical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to predict the students' performance level with an accuracy above 95%, in an early stage of the students' academic path. It is found that random forests are superior to the other classification techniques that were considered (decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, bagged trees and boosted trees). Together with the prediction model, the suggested segmentation framework represents a useful tool to delineate the optimum strategies to apply, in order to promote higher performance levels and mitigate academic failure, overall increasing the quality of the academic experience provided by a higher education institution.","2018-11-01","2023-01-03 16:07:24","2023-01-03 16:09:15","2023-01-03 16:07:24","36-51","","","115","","Decision Support Systems","Early segmentation of students according to their academic performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\MLZ4924T\Miguéis et al. - 2018 - Early segmentation of students according to their .pdf","","","Academic performance; Data mining; Educational data mining; Engineering education; Predictive modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new-fangled approach, shifts away from using an inventory to measure procrastination that avoids self-report bias, poor recall, measurement errors, and researcher selection bias, to directly examining the learning pattern of students based on the exact time acts of procrastination. The findings confirmed the negative effect of academic learning procrastination but also surprisingly found that students who were delayed in their submission were positively related to performance. A relative conception of procrastination is proposed to explain the acts of executing procrastination. An analytical framework with a multimodal emphasis is recommended and outlined for studying procrastination that focuses on sequence analysis as the core model for online education research. The findings also discovered that students strategically used certain studying tactics over time to improve their learning which affects performance that could be discovered from the LMS. These strategies include varying their time length in studying, learning at a specific time of the day & day of the week, and practicing an appropriate launching time length for online learning. As the study was carried out during the COVID-19 period when all the students were restricted to online study, it provided empirical evidence of students in a completely online environment, a baseline for planning future online courses.","2022-12-01","2023-01-03 16:07:50","2023-01-03 16:09:15","2023-01-03 16:07:50","100112","","","3","","Computers and Education Open","The learning process matter","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\QW5TJEUB\Tan and Samavedham - 2022 - The learning process matter A sequence analysis p.pdf","","","Educational data mining; Online learning typology; Prediction of academic performance; Procrastination behavior; Sequence analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent changes in education methods, socio-economic conditions, and the growing limitations of face to face interactions make it necessary to have tools that allow us to consider a broad set of factors related to the dropout phenomenon. The objective of this article is to show the implementation results of a predictive information system (IS) for the prevention of university dropout in a higher education institution. The system allows the calculation of the risk of dropout per student and uses an alert generation procedure to coordinate interventions. The platform allowed measuring the impact of the intervention strategies on the permanence of the students. Likewise, it made possible the reorganization of the intervention process towards the students, prioritizing according to the risk level.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 16:07:57","2023-01-03 16:09:15","2023-01-03 16:07:57","566-571","","","198","","Procedia Computer Science","","12th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks / 11th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\JY3KKH4B\Guzmán-Castillo et al. - 2022 - Implementation of a Predictive Information System .pdf","","","Dropout; education; prevention; university","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
