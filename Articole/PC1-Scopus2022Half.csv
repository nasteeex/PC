It is directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system. Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems, especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning, which has been used for decades in data processing in different contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification in the application of this technique to extract relevant information from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions. The proposed system claims an outperforming accuracy of 96.6% with various previous research works as well as found that the majority of attributes related to school activities as compared to data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. © 2022 The Authors.","2022","2023-01-03 16:48:35","2023-01-03 16:48:36","","84-92","","11","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\EENS2LW9\Begum and Padmannavar - 2022 - Student performance prediction with BPSO feature s.pdf","","","Binary particle swarm optimization; Convolution neural network; Data mining; Deep learning; Educational data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning techniques may be used as an important tool for predicting low-performers in educational institutions. In the present paper, five single-supervised machine learning techniques have been used, including Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. To analyze the effect of an imbalanced dataset, the performance of these algorithms has been checked with and without various resampling methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Borderline SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN). The Random hold-out method and GridSearchCV were used as model validation techniques and hyper-parameter tuning respectively. The results of the present study indicated that Logistic Regression is the best performing classifier with every balanced dataset generated using all of the four resampling techniques and also achieved the highest accuracy of 94.54% with SMOTE. Furthermore, to improve the prediction results and to make the model scalable, the most suitable classifier was integrated with the help of bagging, and a well-accepted accuracy of 95.45% was achieved. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

It has become an imperative research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of student performance prediction in the context of educational data mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of student performance prediction and compare approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for students’ performance prediction. Students’ academic records and demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable information to researchers interested in advancing educational data mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate prediction results in different scenarios using different available inputs or techniques. The study also helps institutions apply data mining techniques to predict and improve student outcomes by providing additional assistance on time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2023-01-03 16:51:27","2023-01-03 16:51:27","","","","","","","","Educational data mining to predict students' academic performance","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","Educational data mining; Predictive analysis; Students attributes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acceptance of Technology enabled the teaching-learning processes, as it has become a vital element to perceive the goal of academic quality. Research is improving and growing fast in Educational Data Mining (EDM) due to many students' information. Researchers urge to invent valuable patterns about students' learning behavior using their data that needs to be adequately processed to transform it into helpful information. This paper proposes a prediction model of students' academic performances with new data features, including student's behavioral features, Psychometric, family support, learning logs via e-learning management systems, and demographic information. In this paper, data collection and pre-processing are firstly conducted following the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic scores. Later, we selected the applicable supervised learning algorithms, and then the experimental work was implemented. The performance of the student's predictive model assessment is comprised of three steps: First, the critical Feature selection approach is evaluated. Second, a set of renowned classifiers are trained and tested. Third, ensemble meta-based models are improvised to boost the accuracy of the classifier. Subsequently, the present study is associated with the solutions that help the students evaluate and improve their academic performance with a glimpse of their historical grades. Ultimately, the results were produced and evaluated. The results showed the effectiveness of our proposed framework in predicting students' academic performance. © 2022, Zarka Private University.

This document presents an experimental study to obtain a predictive model that allows anticipating a university dropout. The study uses 51,497 instances with 26 attributes obtained from social sciences, administrative sciences, and engineering collected from 2010 to 2019. Artificial neural networks and decision trees were implemented as classification algorithms, and also, algorithms of attribute selection and resampling methods were used to balance the main class. The results show that the best performing model was that of Random Forest with a Matthew correlation coefficient of 87.43% against 53.39% obtained by artificial neural networks and 94.34% accuracy by Random Forest. The model has allowed predicting an approximate number of possible dropouts per period, contributing to the involved instances in preventing or reducing dropout in higher education. © 2022, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

The most important corner stone in the educational process is students' performance. Therefore, early prediction of students' performance aims to assist at-risk students by providing appropriate and early support and intervention. The objective of this paper is to propose an enhanced predictive model for students' performance prediction. Selecting the most important features is a crucial indicator for the academic institutions to make an appropriate intervention to help students with poor performance and the top influencing features were selected in feature selection step besides the dimensionality reduction and build an efficient predictive model. DB-Scan clustering technique is applied to enhance the proposed predictive model performance in the preprocessing step. Various classification techniques are used such as Decision Tree, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron. Moreover ensemble method is used to solve the trade-off between the bias and the variance and there are two proposed ensemble methods through the experiments to be compared. The proposed model is an ensemble classifier of Multilayer Perceptron, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 83.16%. © 2022.
