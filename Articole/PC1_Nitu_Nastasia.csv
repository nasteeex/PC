Many researchers recently tackled this problem by proposing different frameworks for predicting students' academic performance. However, previous work relies heavily on feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, manipulating, and constructing new variables from raw data using domain knowledge. A disadvantage of feature engineering is that the features are tailored to a specific dataset making the constructed models inflexible when used in new datasets. A direct consequence is that features need to be rebuilt for each course. This paper proposes a more flexible framework to predict the students' academic performance. In this framework, the raw data is used directly to construct the prediction model without the feature engineering step. The feature selection is instead based on model interpretability. The framework is applied to the open university learning analytics dataset (OULAD) with two different type of classifiers: random forest and artificial neural networks. Obtained results show that the feature engineering step can be abandoned without affecting the models' prediction performance. The prediction results of the flexible feature selection framework either outperform or have a difference of less than 1% accuracy compared to other work in the literature that relies on a manual feature engineering step. Both random forest and artificial neural networks without feature engineering accomplish a high prediction accuracy for the case of students at risk of failing with 86% and 88% compared to all students with pass grades and students with distinction grades, respectively. Also, the prediction models have the highest accuracy rate of 93% in predicting drop-out students. Yet, the prediction models in the proposed framework and previous research work perform poorly in predicting high achieving students with maximum accuracy of 81%, a precision of 69%, and a recall of 57%.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","100103","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\E46A96UX\Al-Zawqari et al. - 2022 - A flexible feature selection approach for predicti.pdf","","","Deep learning; Feature selection; Learning analytics; Random forest classifier; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:40:45","2023-01-03 15:40:45","2023-01-03 15:40:45","100066","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Predicting student's dropout in university classes using two-layer ensemble machine learning approach","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\YR5NPMG2\Niyogisubizo et al. - 2022 - Predicting student's dropout in university classes.pdf","","","Learning analytics; Educational data mining; Agents of education; Artificial intelligence; Student dropout prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as artificial intelligence is widely used for self-assessment in various educational contexts, numerous behaviors have been identified, including nonstandard behaviors that can negatively impact learning. Therefore, more analysis regarding students' self-assessment behaviors in different contexts and their influence on learning is required. In this study, we examined students’ behaviors in online self-assessment task and how it affects their learning performance. A 6-week experiment was conducted in an accounting course. Students were instructed to complete online self-assessment in the form of formative quizzes after class. We performed clustering analysis, which revealed three behavioral patterns in online self-assessment, and we compared the learning performance of students across different patterns. The results indicated that students who frequently took the online assessments after class tended to achieve a higher examination score than those who did not. However, the learning performance of students who demonstrated nonstandard behaviors did not necessarily improve, even though they actively took the assessments. Our results suggest that student behavior is a critical factor in improving learning through self-assessment. These findings provide insights for researchers in the learning analytics field as well as for practitioners who wish to adopt online self-assessment for learning.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:47:48","2023-01-03 15:47:48","2023-01-03 15:47:48","100058","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\JU6RS8AT\Yang et al. - 2022 - How students’ self-assessment behavior affects the.pdf","","","Learning analytics; Online self-assessment; Online self-assessment behaviors; Student interaction analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we focused on the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses: self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict completion of the course: the submission status of an optional assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP). Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns in online courses and to design future effective interventions are discussed.

It is directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system. Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems, especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning, which has been used for decades in data processing in different contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification in the application of this technique to extract relevant information from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions.

Machine learning techniques may be used as an important tool for predicting low-performers in educational institutions. In the present paper, five single-supervised machine learning techniques have been used, including Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. To analyze the effect of an imbalanced dataset, the performance of these algorithms has been checked with and without various resampling methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Borderline SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN). The Random hold-out method and GridSearchCV were used as model validation techniques and hyper-parameter tuning respectively. The results of the present study indicated that Logistic Regression is the best performing classifier with every balanced dataset generated using all of the four resampling techniques and also achieved the highest accuracy of 94.54% with SMOTE. Furthermore, to improve the prediction results and to make the model scalable, the most suitable classifier was integrated with the help of bagging, and a well-accepted accuracy of 95.45% was achieved. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Acceptance of Technology enabled the teaching-learning processes, as it has become a vital element to perceive the goal of academic quality. Research is improving and growing fast in Educational Data Mining (EDM) due to many students' information. Researchers urge to invent valuable patterns about students' learning behavior using their data that needs to be adequately processed to transform it into helpful information. This paper proposes a prediction model of students' academic performances with new data features, including student's behavioral features, Psychometric, family support, learning logs via e-learning management systems, and demographic information. In this paper, data collection and pre-processing are firstly conducted following the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic scores. Later, we selected the applicable supervised learning algorithms, and then the experimental work was implemented. The performance of the student's predictive model assessment is comprised of three steps: First, the critical Feature selection approach is evaluated. Second, a set of renowned classifiers are trained and tested. Third, ensemble meta-based models are improvised to boost the accuracy of the classifier. Subsequently, the present study is associated with the solutions that help the students evaluate and improve their academic performance with a glimpse of their historical grades. Ultimately, the results were produced and evaluated. The results showed the effectiveness of our proposed framework in predicting students' academic performance. © 2022, Zarka Private University.
