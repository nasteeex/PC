A single classifier algorithm will be compared against the performance and efficiency of ensemble classifiers. Reducing student attrition is a major problem for educational institutions all over the world. The search for solutions to increase student retention and graduation rates continues for educators. This is only possible if at-risk students are identified and intervened with as soon as possible. However, the majority of regularly used prediction models are inefficient and inaccurate as a result of inherent classifier limitations and the inclusion of insignificant inputs in their calculations. The majority of data mining and machine learning researcher focused on developing an algorithm that can extract useful information from massive amounts of data after being processed by a computer. The most difficult problem in predictive modelling is identifying the most effective prediction algorithms that are also accurate enough to be useful. Therefore, a multi-level homogeneous ensemble predictive (MLHoEP) model is designed, which uses the different techniques of data mining like feature selection, ensemble learning techniques like boosting and bagging. Seven distinct machine learning algorithms were used on this model to predict and analyse the academic performance of the students. The performance of the classification algorithms in terms of prediction was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by suggesting the development of homogeneous classifiers that may be used to accurately predict students’ academic success. It also proposes the construction of homogeneous classifiers, which may be deployed for accurate student performance prediction, in order to provide a better explanation for the poor performance prediction. As a result of this research, it has been demonstrated that the technique of applying homogeneous ensemble approaches is incredibly efficient and accurate in terms of predicting student performance and assisting in identifying students, who are in danger of dropping out of school. The study compared the accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers to ensembles of classifiers in terms of performance. It was discovered in the research that a homogeneous model with excellent accuracy and efficiency might be developed for anticipating student performance. These key problems have been successfully addressed by the findings of this research study: Which characteristics of students are the most effective predictors of academic performance? How accurate are approaches such as bagging and boosting ensembles for predicting student academic performance? The approach offered in this study will aid educational administrators and policymakers in designing new policies and curriculum-linked to student retention in higher education. This research can also aid in the identification of students who are at risk of dropping out of school early, providing for timely intervention and support. Prospective research will examine the creation and implementation of an automated prediction system known as the students’ academic performance forecast framework, which will collect data from students via online submission and produce a prediction result for their academic performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2023","2023-01-03 16:47:56","2023-01-03 16:48:14","","139-159","","","473","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","ISBN: 9789811928208","","","","","Correlation attribute evaluation; Educational data mining; Ensemble learning; Gain ratio; Information gain; Multilayer perceptron; Naïve Bayes; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system. Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems, especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning, which has been used for decades in data processing in different contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification in the application of this technique to extract relevant information from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions. The proposed system claims an outperforming accuracy of 96.6% with various previous research works as well as found that the majority of attributes related to school activities as compared to data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. © 2022 The Authors.","2022","2023-01-03 16:48:35","2023-01-03 16:48:36","","84-92","","11","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\EENS2LW9\Begum and Padmannavar - 2022 - Student performance prediction with BPSO feature s.pdf","","","Binary particle swarm optimization; Convolution neural network; Data mining; Deep learning; Educational data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous studies used questionnaires, surveys, and/or interviews to investigate factors affecting students’ learning performance. These methods cannot help universities to provide on-time support to excellent and poor students. Thus, this study utilized Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms to build prediction models for the academic performance of international students, students with disabilities, and local students based on students’ admission profiles and their first-semester Grade Point Average results. The real samples included 4036 freshmen of a Taiwanese technical and vocational university. The experimental results showed that for international students, three models: SVM (100%), MLP (100%), and DT (100%) were significantly superior to RF (96.6%); for students with disabilities, SVM (100%) outperformed RF (98.0%), MLP (96.0%), and DT (94.0%); for local students, RF (98.6%) outperformed DT (95.2%) MLP (94.9%), and SVM (91.9%). The most important features were [numbers of required credits], [main source of living expenses], [department], [father occupations], [mother occupations], [numbers of elective credits], [parent average income per month], and [father education]. The outcomes of this study may assist academic communities in proposing preventive measures at the early stages to attract more international students and enhance school competitive advantages. © 2022 by the authors.","2022","2023-01-03 16:48:58","2023-01-03 16:48:58","","","","3","6","","","Learning Performance of International Students and Students with Disabilities","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\38DZ6BKM\Huynh-Cam et al. - 2022 - Learning Performance of International Students and.pdf","","","educational data mining; international students; learning performance prediction; students with disabilities; technological and vocational education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research aims at predicting students' completion based on socio-demographic information. Unlike previous work, a dynamic prediction model was proposed here. Real data of 13262 undergraduate students at a public university in Iraq was integrated and cleaned first. This was followed by applying several feature selection techniques to identify relevant socio-demographic features that can affect the prediction of students' completion. This includes using correlation-based feature subset selection (CfsSubsetEval), symmetrical uncertainty with respect to the class (SymmetricalUncertAttributeEval), GainRatioAttributeEval, ReliefFAttributeEval, and CorrelationAttributeEval. Finally, a prediction model was built based on six prediction approaches which are Bagging, DecisionTable, HoeffdingTree, IBK, J48, RandomForest, and RandomTree. Overall, several different features showed a significant effect on students' completion in which societal regression and the type of secondary school had the highest weight. Furthermore, comparing the accuracy of the implemented classification techniques can reveal that the Bagging classifier outperforms other approaches. The accuracy of predicting students' completion based on this method was 87.56%.

The main objective of this study was to predict the at-risk student of failing the preparatory year at an early stage. This study applies several educational data mining algorithms including RF, ANN, and SVM to build three classification models to meet the objectives of this study. Moreover, different features selection methods namely RFE, and GA have been examined to find the best subset of the highest influential features. Furthermore, several sampling approaches are applied to balance the dataset used in this study, including SMOTE, and SMOTE-Tomek Link. Three datasets related to the preparatory year student from the humanities track at IAU were used in this study. The collected datasets are imbalanced datasets, SMOTE-Tomek Link technique has been used to balance the three proposed datasets. The results showed that RF outperformed other techniques as it records the highest performance for building the models.

Machine learning techniques may be used as an important tool for predicting low-performers in educational institutions. In the present paper, five single-supervised machine learning techniques have been used, including Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. To analyze the effect of an imbalanced dataset, the performance of these algorithms has been checked with and without various resampling methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Borderline SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE, and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN). The Random hold-out method and GridSearchCV were used as model validation techniques and hyper-parameter tuning respectively. The results of the present study indicated that Logistic Regression is the best performing classifier with every balanced dataset generated using all of the four resampling techniques and also achieved the highest accuracy of 94.54% with SMOTE. Furthermore, to improve the prediction results and to make the model scalable, the most suitable classifier was integrated with the help of bagging, and a well-accepted accuracy of 95.45% was achieved. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

It has become an imperative research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of student performance prediction in the context of educational data mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of student performance prediction and compare approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for students’ performance prediction. Students’ academic records and demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable information to researchers interested in advancing educational data mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate prediction results in different scenarios using different available inputs or techniques. The study also helps institutions apply data mining techniques to predict and improve student outcomes by providing additional assistance on time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2023-01-03 16:51:27","2023-01-03 16:51:27","","","","","","","","Educational data mining to predict students' academic performance","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","Educational data mining; Predictive analysis; Students attributes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acceptance of Technology enabled the teaching-learning processes, as it has become a vital element to perceive the goal of academic quality. Research is improving and growing fast in Educational Data Mining (EDM) due to many students' information. Researchers urge to invent valuable patterns about students' learning behavior using their data that needs to be adequately processed to transform it into helpful information. This paper proposes a prediction model of students' academic performances with new data features, including student's behavioral features, Psychometric, family support, learning logs via e-learning management systems, and demographic information. In this paper, data collection and pre-processing are firstly conducted following the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic scores. Later, we selected the applicable supervised learning algorithms, and then the experimental work was implemented. The performance of the student's predictive model assessment is comprised of three steps: First, the critical Feature selection approach is evaluated. Second, a set of renowned classifiers are trained and tested. Third, ensemble meta-based models are improvised to boost the accuracy of the classifier. Subsequently, the present study is associated with the solutions that help the students evaluate and improve their academic performance with a glimpse of their historical grades.
