Many researchers recently tackled this problem by proposing different frameworks for predicting students' academic performance. However, previous work relies heavily on feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, manipulating, and constructing new variables from raw data using domain knowledge. A disadvantage of feature engineering is that the features are tailored to a specific dataset making the constructed models inflexible when used in new datasets. A direct consequence is that features need to be rebuilt for each course. This paper proposes a more flexible framework to predict the students' academic performance. In this framework, the raw data is used directly to construct the prediction model without the feature engineering step. The feature selection is instead based on model interpretability. The framework is applied to the open university learning analytics dataset (OULAD) with two different type of classifiers: random forest and artificial neural networks. Obtained results show that the feature engineering step can be abandoned without affecting the models' prediction performance. The prediction results of the flexible feature selection framework either outperform or have a difference of less than 1% accuracy compared to other work in the literature that relies on a manual feature engineering step. Both random forest and artificial neural networks without feature engineering accomplish a high prediction accuracy for the case of students at risk of failing with 86% and 88% compared to all students with pass grades and students with distinction grades, respectively. Also, the prediction models have the highest accuracy rate of 93% in predicting drop-out students. Yet, the prediction models in the proposed framework and previous research work perform poorly in predicting high achieving students with maximum accuracy of 81%, a precision of 69%, and a recall of 57%.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","2023-01-03 15:33:39","100103","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\E46A96UX\Al-Zawqari et al. - 2022 - A flexible feature selection approach for predicti.pdf","","","Deep learning; Feature selection; Learning analytics; Random forest classifier; Virtual learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, the common e-learning platform only realizes the simple statistics and display function for the data, and does not do further in-depth calculation. The data observed by educators are still superficial learning phenomena, and they cannot see the learning rules behind the appearance. It is difficult to effectively guide students, change their learning routes and feedback teaching strategies. In view of this, the main characteristics of learning behavior deeply mined from learning activities and learning evaluation, and the important data feature items affect E-learning effect obtained.

It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:40:45","2023-01-03 15:40:45","2023-01-03 15:40:45","100066","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","Predicting student's dropout in university classes using two-layer ensemble machine learning approach","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\YR5NPMG2\Niyogisubizo et al. - 2022 - Predicting student's dropout in university classes.pdf","","","Agents of education; Artificial intelligence; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Student dropout prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work aims to fill the identified gap by conducting a systematic literature review. It was recognized that the interest in the topic, in the context of middle and high schools, has accompanied the tendency of research on student performance prediction in universities. However, the exploration of semi-structured data with deep neural networks, which is a recurrent theme in the universities context, is still incipient.

The evaluation of student performance in educational institutions reveals the degree of effort that educational institutions should do in order to improve the poor or average learner. The importance of using EDM models is that they leverage prior data from students to forecast unanticipated or impending student performance. Though the educational sector employs a variety of techniques to extract meaningful information about the characteristics of students who participate in the learning process, a student performance assessment model is required to assist students and faculty in moving their performance to the next level.

However, as artificial intelligence is widely used for self-assessment in various educational contexts, numerous behaviors have been identified, including nonstandard behaviors that can negatively impact learning. Therefore, more analysis regarding students' self-assessment behaviors in different contexts and their influence on learning is required. In this study, we examined students’ behaviors in online self-assessment task and how it affects their learning performance. A 6-week experiment was conducted in an accounting course. Students were instructed to complete online self-assessment in the form of formative quizzes after class. We performed clustering analysis, which revealed three behavioral patterns in online self-assessment, and we compared the learning performance of students across different patterns. The results indicated that students who frequently took the online assessments after class tended to achieve a higher examination score than those who did not. However, the learning performance of students who demonstrated nonstandard behaviors did not necessarily improve, even though they actively took the assessments. Our results suggest that student behavior is a critical factor in improving learning through self-assessment. These findings provide insights for researchers in the learning analytics field as well as for practitioners who wish to adopt online self-assessment for learning.","2022-01-01","2023-01-03 15:47:48","2023-01-03 15:47:48","2023-01-03 15:47:48","100058","","","3","","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\JU6RS8AT\Yang et al. - 2022 - How students’ self-assessment behavior affects the.pdf","","","Learning analytics; Online self-assessment; Online self-assessment behaviors; Student interaction analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aimed to characterize learners according to their learning patterns and to identify indicators that predict students' success in an online environment. Specifically, we focused on the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses: self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict completion of the course: the submission status of an optional assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP). Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns in online courses and to design future effective interventions are discussed. Regarding students, we emphasize the importance of time management and how choices they make with respect to their learning process affect their potential for success.","2022-10-01","2023-01-03 16:07:00","2023-01-03 16:09:15","2023-01-03 16:07:00","100867","","","55","","The Internet and Higher Education","Let them choose","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\QQIS6X3I\Feldman-Maggor et al. - 2022 - Let them choose Optional assignments and online l.pdf","","","Adult learning; Chemistry education; Educational data mining; General chemistry; Logistic regression; Online learning; Self-regulated learning; Undergraduate students; Video","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
