To become a better teacher, teachers need to anticipate their pupils' performance patterns. Knowledge gained from it can be used in various ways, such as a strategic plan for delivering high-quality education. This report suggests that students' final grades can be predicted using data mining techniques based on past research. On two educational datasets related to mathematics classes and Portuguese language lessons, three well-known data mining approaches, such as Decision Tree, JRip, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest, were utilized in the experiments. As a result, using the employed data mining methods, student success might be predicted with reasonable accuracy.","2022-03","2023-01-03 16:22:35","2023-01-03 16:22:35","","1013-1017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\BQHPREM5\Kumar et al. - 2022 - Analysis of Feature Selection and Data Mining Tech.pdf","","","Classification algorithms; Classification Algorithms; Data mining; Decision Tree; Education; Feature extraction; Forestry; JRip; Mathematics; Multilayer Perceptron; Multilayer perceptrons; Naïve Bayes; Random Forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Applications (DASA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this direction, Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a rapidly trending research area that utilizes the essence of Data Mining (DM) concepts to help academic institutions figure out useful information on the Student Satisfaction Level (SSL) with the Online Learning process (OL) during COVID-19 lock-down. Different practices have been tried with EDM to predict students’ behaviors to reach the best educational settings. Therefore, Feature Selection (FS) is typically employed to find the most relevant subset of features with minimum cardinality. As the predictive accuracy of a satisfaction model is significantly influenced by the FS process, the effectiveness of the SSL model is elaborately studied in this paper in connection with FS techniques. In this connection, a dataset was first collected online via a questionnaire of student reviews on OL courses. Using this datatset, the performance of wrapper FS techniques in DM and classification algorithms was analyzed in terms of fitness values. Ultimately, the goodness of subsets with different cardinalities is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and number of selected features by measuring the quality of 11 wrapper-based FS algorithms and the $k$ -Nearest Neighbor ( $k$ -NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as base-line classifiers. Based on the experiments, the optimal dimensionality of the feature subset was revealed, as well as the best method. The findings of the present study evidently support the well-known conjunction of the existence of minimum number of features and an increase in predictive accuracy. It is remarkable the relevancy of FS for high-accuracy SSL prediction, as the relevant set of features can effectively assist in deriving constructive educational strategies. Our study contributes a feature size reduction of up to 80% along with up to 100% classification accuracy on the adopted real-time dataset.","2022","2023-01-03 16:23:00","2023-01-03 16:23:00","","6286-6303","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\B59V9KWA\Abdelkader et al. - 2022 - An Efficient Data Mining Technique for Assessing S.pdf","","","Classification; Classification algorithms; COVID-19; Data mining; Education; educational data mining (EDM); Epidemics; feature selection (FS); machine learning (ML); online learning (OL); Optimization; student satisfaction level (SSL); Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
