P.","Higher education student dropout prediction and analysis through educational data mining","2018 2nd International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control (ICISC)","","","10.1109/ICISC.2018.8398887","","In past years the number of student dropout from the educational institute is increasing rapidly. The high rate of student's dropout in a registered course has been a major threat to many educational institutions or universities. The student enters the institution with lots of dreams and expectations. When their expectations are not fulfilling or certain factors like demographics will effect and makes them drop from their registered program. It is a major threat to all educational institution. The various technique of the dimensionality reduction, which includes feature selection and feature extraction. Feature selection is step by step procedure that is used to select the right attribute from a given attribute sets. For the feature extraction process, it involves the transformation of higher dimensions' data in corresponding lower dimensions. Feature selection consists of factors like Academics, demographical factors, psychological factors, health issues, teacher's opinion, student behavior. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to predict the student dropout using Naive-Bayes Classification Algorithm in R language. And also examine the reason for student drop out at an early state and predict whether the student will drop or not. There are many factors that affect a student to commit dropout as we mentioned above. Early dropout prediction helps the organization to retain the students from the respective academic program.","2018-01","2023-01-03 16:22:20","2023-01-03 16:22:20","","694-699","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\CRVA4MBQ\Hegde and Prageeth - 2018 - Higher education student dropout prediction and an.pdf","","","Classification algorithms; Conferences; Data mining; Data preprocessing; Dimensionality reduction; Dropout; EDM; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Retention; Testing; Training data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 2nd International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control (ICISC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, Educational Data Mining (EDM) concept emerges to adapt Data Mining (DM) techniques to extract the hidden and valuable educational knowledge that improves the learning process. The primary purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient student's performance prediction model. For this purpose, a feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron approach boosted with stochastic training algorithms is proposed. The proposed model is benchmarked and assessed using three public educational datasets gathered from UCI and Kaggle repositories. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized to handle the imbalanced data problem. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by a set of classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Random Forest.

However, current work is often not sufficiently accurate in predicting student performance. Firstly, the students' features are not adequately processed, resulting in a large amount of noise data in the student dataset, affecting the prediction results. Secondly, there is still space for improvement in the current studies on the student performance prediction model. Therefore, in this paper, the Multi-Agent System (MAS) idea is used to propose an Agent-based Modeling Feature Selection(ABMFS) model, and the selected feature subset effectively removes the features that are irrelevant to the prediction results. Next, the Deep Learning techniques are used to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based structure to predict student performance. The result of the experiments shows that the ABMFS Model selects the targeted features and improved performance noticeably across different classifiers, and better prediction results are achieved when the proposed approach was used for student performance prediction.","2021-12","2023-01-03 16:22:41","2023-01-03 16:22:41","","681-688","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2470-6698","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\BHIWH7RY\Liu and Niu - 2021 - A Student Performance Predication Approach Based o.pdf","","","Agent-based modeling; Agent-Based Modeling; CNN; Deep learning; Mathematical models; Measurement; Multi-Agent system; Predictive models; Real-time systems; Student Performance Prediction; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology & Education (TALE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a field of study, which is related to various attributes for analysis student's details such as name, attendance, class test, lab test, spot test, assignment and result in the educational institution. In this study, we mainly focus on calculating the academic performance of undergraduate students with a predictive data mining model by using feature selection techniques with classification algorithms. Feature selection techniques are introduced on the data preprocessing process to find the most inherent and important attributes so that we analyze and evaluate the student's better performance by using classifiers with those selected attributes. For this purpose, we collected 800 student's records of the final year, studying at the undergraduate level of the department of Computer Science and Engineering from North Western University, Khulna. Here, we used and evaluated the performance of four feature selection methods: genetic algorithms, gain ratio, relief, and information gain and five classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Bagging, Random forest, and J48 Decision Tree. The experimental results depict that Genetic algorithms method provides the best accuracy 91.37% with KNN classifier.","2020-07","2023-01-03 16:22:58","2023-01-03 16:22:58","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\LGZDWWMX\Ahmed et al. - 2020 - A Comprehensive Analysis on Undergraduate Student .pdf","","","Bagging; classification algorithm; Classification algorithms; Data mining; Educational data mining; Feature extraction; feature selection; genetic algorithm; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Random forests; student performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 11th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this direction, Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a rapidly trending research area that utilizes the essence of Data Mining (DM) concepts to help academic institutions figure out useful information on the Student Satisfaction Level (SSL) with the Online Learning process (OL) during COVID-19 lock-down. Different practices have been tried with EDM to predict students’ behaviors to reach the best educational settings. Therefore, Feature Selection (FS) is typically employed to find the most relevant subset of features with minimum cardinality. As the predictive accuracy of a satisfaction model is significantly influenced by the FS process, the effectiveness of the SSL model is elaborately studied in this paper in connection with FS techniques. In this connection, a dataset was first collected online via a questionnaire of student reviews on OL courses. Using this datatset, the performance of wrapper FS techniques in DM and classification algorithms was analyzed in terms of fitness values. Ultimately, the goodness of subsets with different cardinalities is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and number of selected features by measuring the quality of 11 wrapper-based FS algorithms and the $k$ -Nearest Neighbor ( $k$ -NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as base-line classifiers. Based on the experiments, the optimal dimensionality of the feature subset was revealed, as well as the best method. The findings of the present study evidently support the well-known conjunction of the existence of minimum number of features and an increase in predictive accuracy. It is remarkable the relevancy of FS for high-accuracy SSL prediction, as the relevant set of features can effectively assist in deriving constructive educational strategies. Our study contributes a feature size reduction of up to 80% along with up to 100% classification accuracy on the adopted real-time dataset.","2022","2023-01-03 16:23:00","2023-01-03 16:23:00","","6286-6303","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\B59V9KWA\Abdelkader et al. - 2022 - An Efficient Data Mining Technique for Assessing S.pdf","","","Classification; Classification algorithms; COVID-19; Data mining; Education; educational data mining (EDM); Epidemics; feature selection (FS); machine learning (ML); online learning (OL); Optimization; student satisfaction level (SSL); Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional machine learning algorithms as discussed in the literature contain certain drawbacks in terms of lack of accuracy, prediction analysis, and hence unable to establish the results of student performance. The objective of this paper is to propose an Advanced Feature Selection Algorithm to effectively apply educational data mining for performance. The algorithm is based upon Hadoop and Map Reduce framework. This study also consists of a comparative analysis of various feature selection algorithms such as jrip, naïve Bayes, decision table, etc., which evaluates the correctness of the data based on three parameters: memory, accuracy, and f-metrics. Overall, as per results received from comparative analysis, our proposed algorithm is a faster, accurate, and efficient way for administering educational data mining when compared to other algorithms.","2021-03","2023-01-03 16:23:03","2023-01-03 16:23:03","","349-353","","","","","","AFSA","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\AM7D7P5K\Gera et al. - 2021 - AFSA A comprehensive analysis of Educational Big .pdf","","","Advanced Feature Selection Algorithm (AFSA); Big Data; Classification; Data mining; Educational Data Mining; Feature extraction; Hadoop and MapReduce; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Redundancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessment of students' performance is of great importance for themselves as well as benefitting the educational institutes. In this regard, main attributes are generally proclaimed in the educational data mining (EDM) settings as a significant concern in learning analytics. In this research, we improved the prediction of students' performance. We evaluated the features containing six attributes in several domains: demographic, personal, academic, parental support, psychometric, and learning logs. The prediction of different classification algorithms using ensemble methods affects the accuracy and comprehensibility of the early prediction. To do so, we improvised attributes selection techniques applied to the data containing 11814 students in the biology course. The validation of the classification algorithms achieves better accuracy with ensemble methods. The result performances show the appropriateness of performing prediction and evaluating both filter and wrapper-based methods for feature selection. Our findings also show the students' performance with the most impactful features using ensemble methods and the feasibility of creating a prediction model with a reasonable accuracy rate.","2021-12","2023-01-03 16:23:06","2023-01-03 16:23:06","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\nasta\Zotero\storage\C3P2FR64\Memon et al. - 2021 - An Ensemble Classification Approach Using Improvis.pdf","","","and Filter Methods; Biology; Classification algorithms; Data mining; Educational Data Mining; Ensemble Classification; Feature extraction; Filtering algorithms; Information filters; Machine Learning; Predictive models; Students' Performance; Wrapper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 22nd International Arab Conference on Information Technology (ACIT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
